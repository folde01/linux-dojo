Exercise 1:
###########
Our manager provided us with a text file (./linux_desktop_packages) containing a list of Ubuntu Desktop packages.

We will need to extrapolate the names of the first 10 packages whose name start with 'lib'. Additionally:
    - each name should be on a new line
    - each name should *not* contain information about the package's version or the CPU reference.

Can this be done in one single command?

################
Extra challenge:
################ 
For each of the 10 selected package, we should search a brief description contained in the apt-cache. 
$apt-cache search [package's name]

We should then print the resulting output in the following format:

package name: package description 

This output should be saved to a file called "lib_packages_descriptions.txt"
