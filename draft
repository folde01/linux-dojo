- introduction

- Linux philosophy: many  little, robust programs that do one thing very well

- TIMTOWTDI (Tim Toady) - originally from the Perl community, but applies well to general Linux scripting I think

- In contrast with Python's Zen: ""There should be one — and preferably only one — obvious way to do it." 

- more things than you may think can be done efficiently (and for free) from the commandline:
    - PDF editing;
    - image editing
    - testing RESTful API
