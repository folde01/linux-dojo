- introduction

- Linux philosophy: many  little, robust programs that do one thing very well

- TIMTOWTDI (Tim Toady) - originally from the Perl community, but applies well to general Linux scripting I think

- In contrast with Python's Zen: ""There should be one — and preferably only one — obvious way to do it." 

- more things than you may think can be done efficiently (and for free) from the commandline:
    - PDF editing;
    - image editing
    - browsing the Internet
    - testing RESTful API

- Linux pipelines and functional programming

Example 1:
Our manager asked us to make a short report of all the commits that were done for the code-dojo repository (https://github.com/folde01/linux-dojo).
He/she tells us that the report must follow some specific format requirements:
- it should contain only the commit hash codes;
- it should contain only the first 6 digits;
- all of them must be all-caps;

He/she also tells us that we need to make a command that sends us back to the first commit in the repository.
How can we do this with a one-liner?
